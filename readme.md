# MedgeGlow

A simple menu bar app to overlay a colored glow around your display.

MedgeGlow was created to help mitigate my monitor's backlight bleed. Around the edges of my monitor is a light pink-ish tint â€” by overlaying a light green tint, I'm able to counteract the backlight bleed to some extent.

Currently, there is no packaged release of MedgeGlow. You are welcome to compile it for yourself.
